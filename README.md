# Drowsiness-Detection-Web-app
Prevents sleep deprivation road accidents, by alerting drowsy drivers.
In this project, we have trained a convolutional neural network, to determine whether the eyes are closed or not, further, eye-patches are extracted from the face image to make all predictions. The dataset used for the training process can be accessed from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kutaykutlu/drowsiness-detection" target="_blank">here.</a>
